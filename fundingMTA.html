      <br>
      <p>On June 5, 2024, the congestion pricing program was postponed, putting $15 billion in MTA transit improvements in jeopardy. Projects such as extending the Second Avenue Subway and modernizing subway signals are on hold. Without congestion pricing revenue, the MTA is unable to issue new bonds for these critical projects. Alternative funding options, such as a new payroll tax increase on the City's businesses, are being considered. Transit leaders have expressed concern about the lack of a backup plan for funding transit investments. On July 29, 2024, the MTA's leaders expressed optimism that Governor Kathy Hochul will restore the $15 billion cut from the agencyâ€™s construction budget, despite her recent pause on congestion pricing. As the agency navigates uncertainty around funding, officials are moving forward with project assumptions while acknowledging that inflation could increase costs.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Calls for alternative measures to generate funds for transit improvements in New York City should include decreasing local bus fares and increasing Manhattan tunnel tolls to increase public transit ridership and funding for the MTA. Installing security cameras at each subway turnstile is also recommended to combat fare evasion, which cost the MTA an estimated $690 million in 2022. Proposals to offer a discount to all CUNY and SUNY students onboard the subway and local buses aim to encourage more students to use public transit and support environmental conservation efforts.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To increase MTA commuter railroad ridership, the MTA has to start charging intermediate fares instead of peak and off-peak fares. CityTicket should provide New Yorkers the same benefits offered in the Long Island Rail Road's former Atlantic Ticket program. Each MTA commuter railroad fare should have at least one local transit transfer. By implementing these changes, the number of people riding the MTA commuter railroads would increase significantly, saving both time and money for riders.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As the MTA grapples with the uncertainty surrounding the Central Business District Tolling Program, stakeholders are seeking creative solutions to ensure the future of public transit in New York City. Overall, the goal is to increase ridership onboard trains and buses and give the MTA more funds to improve.</p>
