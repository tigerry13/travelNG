      <p>The Enhanced Station Initiative of the 2015‚Äì2019 MTA Capital Plan aimed to completely renovate 33 subway stations citywide, with upgrades such as cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, and improved signage. The renovations occurred in several stages, with the first four packages completed by early 2019. Despite initial plans to expand the program, cost overruns forced a scale-back to 19 subway stations, with additional funds redirected to accessibility projects. The Enhanced Station Initiative faced criticism for its high renovation costs and the limited scope of improvements, which did not include installing elevators to meet ADA standards. Despite these challenges, the Enhanced Station Initiative program continued with the completion of the remaining stations and the postponement of others to the 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Plan.</p>

      <p>The Station Re-NEW-vation Program aims to utilize weekend service outages to clean, repair, and renovate subway stations, improving the overall customer experience. Tasks include cleaning, repairing HVAC systems, unclogging drains, replacing outdated signs, rebuilding staircases, and repairing roofs. Over 75 stations have already been renovated, with plans to renovate 50 more each year. The initiative has resulted in repainting 2.2 million square feet, replacing wall and floor tiles, installing new signs, and removing outdated signage. The goal is to provide riders with a cleaner, brighter, and more pleasant subway system experience, with upcoming renovations planned for several stations in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
      <br>
      <p>New Yorkers deserve a lot more than just 8 more Re-NEW-vated subway stations. Whenever a portion of any subway line is closed for the weekend, Re-NEW-vation is needed in all the subway stations that first opened before 1960. These include the 34th Street-Penn Station <font class="subwaySymbol" color="#0039a6">üÖê</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#0039a6">üÖí</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#0039a6">üÖî</font>, Bergen Street <font class="subwaySymbol" color="#ff6319">üÖï</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#6cbe45">üÖñ</font>, and Chambers Street <font class="subwaySymbol" color="#996633">üÖô</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#996633">üÖ©</font> subway stations. Station overhauls help subway riders feel a lot more welcome to the subway on Monday morning. The 55-hour-short Station Re-NEW-vation Program is so much more efficient than having subway stations go through the Enhanced Station Initiative for months.</p>
