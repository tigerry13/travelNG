      <p>The MTA has recently announced some significant changes to improve transit services citywide.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The MTA has proposed several changes to Queens bus routes as part of the Queens Bus Network Redesign project. These changes should include extending the Q52-SBS route from Elmhurst to Woodside to reduce the need for transfers and provide direct access to key transit stops including the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street <font class="subwaySymbol" color="#b933ad">‚ûê</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#0039a6">üÖî</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#ff6319">üÖï</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#ff6319">üÖú</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#caa308">üÖ°</font> subway station complex. Additionally, the plan to combine the Q10 and Q64 routes into one route running along Jewel Avenue and Lefferts Boulevard between Electchester and John F. Kennedy International Airport was considered but ultimately scrapped in December 2023 because of concerns about excessive lengthening and potential delays. In addition to the current plans, there should also be proposals to expand the Q37 route along Jewel Avenue, extending its services from Kew Gardens to Electchester.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The MTA is exploring changes to several Queens express bus routes. The QM5, QM8, and QM35 should be rerouted along the Horace Harding Expressway while retaining most Union Turnpike stops for the QM1, QM6, QM7, QM31, and QM36. Additionally, instead of operating the QM10 and QM40 between LeFrak City and Midtown Manhattan, the QM2 and QM32 should also serve LeFrak City (westbound) and two Horace Harding Expressway stops in Rego Park (eastbound); the QM11 should make all QM12 and QM42 stops in Queens. If this happens, the QM7 should serve the Queens Boulevard <font class="subwaySymbol" color="#0039a6">üÖî</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#ff6319">üÖï</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#ff6319">üÖú</font><font class="subwaySymbol" color="#caa308">üÖ°</font> Line's subway stations between 63rd Drive and Union Turnpike. These proposed changes aim to alleviate traffic congestion and simplify travel for express bus riders. Why were these plans scrapped in December 2023?</p>
      <br>
      <p>Furthermore, the Brooklyn Bus Network Redesign project is supposed to enhance bus travel in Brooklyn by improving connections, simplifying routes, and increasing frequencies. The Draft Plan released in December 2022 includes proposals to streamline the network, create new connections, adjust frequencies, and improve reliability for riders. Because the MTA plans to discontinue B103 Limited service between Midwood and Downtown Brooklyn, extending the route from Midwood to Gravesend instead of operating B6 Limited service would be advantageous for combating hesitation.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We are working to optimize public transit citywide and make it more convenient for everyone. I would love to hear your thoughts on how we can achieve this goal and reduce the number of transfers riders need to make. Do you have any innovative ideas or suggestions to share?</p>
